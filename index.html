                <h1>Thanh tat Vu</h1>
                <p>My name is Thanh, but feel free to address me as Thanh or Terry, whichever suits you best. I have been with Bellevue College for two quarters and as a rising Junior, majoring in Software Development, I am on my journey and actively finding an internship and future job opportunities. However, I am not always a full-time student, before going back to school, I was in the Air Force, and after that, I was a commercial pilot, I was certified by the FAA for Private, Instrument, and Commercial operations. I have Type Rating for A320, A321, and A321 NEO, but I can operate anything from a Cessna to an Airbus A350. Unfortunately, the pandemic arrived and I must say it was not kind to all of us at all. Life happens and, therefore I return to the academic journey. I consider myself a fairly introverted person, I do not want to show up or to be put in the spotlight, but will do whatever it takes to get the job done, as my first flight instructor, Steven Bower, told me, "If you can start the job, then you have to finish it!" For future planning, even though I am studying for a tech occupation, in the tech industry but personally, I am not all fond of it. After 14 different countries and territories, many events were witnessed. I found out that our planet is a beautiful place with many wonders. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about our kind, as Edward O. Wilson used to say, and I quote "Humans are the only species that are cursed with the awareness of their own mortality." Let's just say I find people confusing, and destructive, and our society is getting more and more divided. Therefore, after graduation, ultimately, I envisage a return to military service post-graduation, finding a more resonant environment compared to the corporate world.</p>
